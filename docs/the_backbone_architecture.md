# The backbone architecture

<p align="justify"> Data-driven models can be used to understand how climate change is affecting the frequency and location of wildfire events, according to different future projection scenarios based on different socioeconomic changes.</p>

<p align="justify"> Different DNN architectures must be evaluated to address the various use cases, including Convolutional and Graph networks. The trained models will be used as a base for understanding how different climate scenarios can affect extreme events frequency, locations, probability, etc. Future projection data from large experiments, like the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 6th phase (CMIP6), will be used as input for the trained models. </p>

<p align="justify"> The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10165" style="text-decoration:none;"> Unet++ </a> was chosen as the backbone architecture of the <b>first version</b> of our data-driven model to predict fire danger (burned area maps) based on future climate change projections.</p>
